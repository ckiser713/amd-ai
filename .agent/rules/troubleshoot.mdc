# Execution & Debugging Protocol

## 1. Silent Script Execution
- **Constraint:** When executing the "silent script" (e.g., `./scripts/silent_build_runner.sh`), you MUST suppress all standard output from the terminal.
- **Command Policy:** Use `Turbo` mode for this specific script to avoid approval prompts, provided the command is read-only or part of the defined "Allow list".

## 2. Error Log Isolation
- **Monitoring:** You are STRICTLY PROHIBITED from reading the primary build log or standard terminal output for debugging.
- **Single Source of Truth:** You must ONLY read `error.log` to identify failures. All decision-making evidence must be sourced from this file.
- **Narrative Requirement:** For every failure, build a narrative: "Request X hit endpoint Y, failed because Z" based EXCLUSIVELY on the error stack and traces in `error.log`.

## 3. Feedback Loop & Decision Threshold
- **Decision Logic:** If `error.log` does not contain sufficient details to propose a fix, you must STOP execution.
- **User Escalation:** Do not guess. You must state exactly:
    1. What specific information is missing from `error.log`.
    2. Which other file or context (e.g., a specific trace or environment variable) you require to proceed.
- **Artifact Generation:** Propose your findings as a "Research Loop" artifact before implementing any fix.

## 4. Turbo Mode Allow List
Scripts that may be auto-executed without user approval:
- `./scripts/silent_build_runner.sh` (read-only execution + error logging)
- `cat error.log` (read-only)
- `cat change.log` (read-only)
- `grep` commands on log files (read-only)

## 5. Prohibited Actions
- ❌ Reading `build_logs/*.log` directly for debugging
- ❌ Proposing fixes without first analyzing `error.log`
- ❌ Guessing at root causes without trace evidence
- ❌ Running build commands outside the silent runner framework
