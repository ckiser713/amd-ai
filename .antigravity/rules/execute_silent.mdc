# Protocol: /execute_silent

**Model Context:** You are operating as **Gemini 3**. You have high endurance (15 strikes) because the `silent_build_runner` context window is highly optimized (<2k tokens per loop).

## 1. Information Diet (CRITICAL)
- **Single Source of Truth:** You MUST ONLY read `logs/error.log`.
- **Strict Prohibition:** Do NOT read `build_logs/*.log` or the terminal output buffer.
- **Ambiguity Protocol:** If `error.log` is empty or vague, use `grep` to search for specific error keywords in the referenced files. Do not hallucinate a cause.

## 2. The "High-Endurance" Repair Loop

### Strike Tracking
- **Limit:** Maximum **15 Strikes** (Attempts).
- **Counter:** Starts at 0. Increments on `failure`. 
- **The Reset Rule:** The counter resets to 0 if:
    1. The build reaches 100% success (**Status: COMPLETE**).
    2. A dependency within the build chain successfully compiles (**Incremental Progress**). If the runner logs a successful object/module creation before a subsequent error, the strike count is cleared.

### Attempts 1-14: Rapid Reasoning Cycle
For each failure, execute this sequence **immediately** (Turbo Mode):
1.  **Ingest:** Read `logs/error.log`.
2.  **Analyze:** Map the error stack trace to the source code. Look for logical conflicts, dependency mismatches (specifically `gfx1151`/`znver5` constraints), or syntax errors.
3.  **Plan & Execute:** Apply the surgical fix directly.
4.  **Verify:** Rerun `./scripts/silent_build_runner.sh`.

### Strike 15: The Confidence Checkpoint
If the build fails a **15th consecutive time** without any successful dependency builds in between, you must pause before the 16th attempt.
- **Self-Evaluation:** Evaluate your confidence in the next proposed fix.
- **Threshold:**
    -   **If Confidence ≥ 85%:** Proceed with the fix and rerun the runner.
    -   **If Confidence < 85%:** **HALT** immediately.
- **Escalation (On Halt):** Generate a **Handoff Artifact** containing:
    1.  **The Diagnosis:** Why 15 attempts failed.
    2.  **The Evidence:** The stubborn error lines from `error.log`.
    3.  **The Recommendation:** Switch to **Gemini 1.5 Pro (High)** for larger context windows or **Human Intervention**.

## 3. Turbo Mode Allow List
The following commands do NOT require user approval during this mission:
- `./scripts/silent_build_runner.sh`
- `cat logs/error.log`
- `grep -r "pattern" .` (Read-only searches)
- `sed`, `awk`, or file writes to apply fixes.

## 4. Governance Checks
- **Lock File:** Before editing ANY script, check for `script_name.sh.lock`. If it exists, you **MUST** ask for permission to unlock it.
- **Audit:** Sign `change.log` with "Status: IN_PROGRESS" before starting your first fix.
